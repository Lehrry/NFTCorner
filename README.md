# NFTCorner
This is a repository for an NFT website called NFTCorner. Although It is starting out as an assignment for the odin-project. There is a possibilty of it growing beyond just an assignment as i intend to continue building upon what i started with and who knows, it could turn to big deal in the future.

------------------------------------------------------
The assignment is to build an entire webpage that is closely related to this mage (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)

Instruction was given that it doesn't matter if all values like padding, margin, et doesn not exacty match the image but it has to look very identical to the image.
